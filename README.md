The file "COPII_vesicle_formation.py" runs a simulation. It can take long time, to make it shorter by lowering the parameters: "nSaves" or "save_every".

In the folder script_backups a copy of the script will be saved.
The starting data are in the folder "data".
The resulting data will be placed in the folder "myData".
In the folder "Extra scripts" three scripts are found that I used for generating plots in my Thesis.

The file "COPIIvesicleFormation.py" is for plotting the simulation saved in the "myData"-folder.
